Nifty Dissertation Builder
==========================

This is the Makefile, Python, and LaTeX code that I used to build my
dissertation.
The principle was that everything should be automatically built from the raw
materials:

- Prose written in LaTeX
- Graphs generated from data or calculated
- Bibliography built from my exported Zotero library

I wanted no manual steps involved, because I knew they would come back to bite
me when time was short and I was rushing to get the final version approved and
printed.
I was fairly successful in this approach.

Some things are not included in this repository, so you may need to edit the
Makefile:

- Chapters 4, 5, and 6; they are under University library embargo until May 22,
  2014, or they are published, whichever comes first.
- A few of the illustrations in the preface; I was given license to reprint them
  in the dissertation, and some of them even in a tie-in website, but I don't
  think I can redistribute them on Github.
- The measurement data; it is large and I'd like to find a more suitable and/or
  official place to store it than Github. (If you want the measurement data, you
  can always contact me.)
